# EdTech Multimodal Tutor Chatbot

This project is a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed for the **EdTech domain**, specifically for solving **physics questions**. It supports both **text** and **image-based inputs** using OCR and responds using a physics textbook as its knowledge base.

Hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**

## Demonstration Guide

1. **Upload a physics question as text or image**
2. The chatbot processes the input using OCR (if image)
3. A relevant context is retrieved from the vector store
4. Groq LLM generates a physics-grounded answer
5. The response is shown on the screen!
